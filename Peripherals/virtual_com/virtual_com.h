/**
 * This is the header file for functions that utilize the
 * virtual com on the STM32 micro-controller.
 * 
 * These functions will ideally serve as a logging function, 
 * since it requires no additional hardware (unlike other USART 
 * peripherals.)
 * 
 * For now, the virtual com will be polling-based, unidirectional, 
 * with no hardware control (assume logging messages are short.) 
 *
 * If required, this implementation could be changed to interrupt-based, 
 * with a transmitting/receiving queue and hardware control.
